# Introduction

To get started with the Autocredit API, you'll need a [Demo Account](https://demo.autocredit.ng/).

Now that you've got a demo account, obtain your demo API keys from the [Autocredit Dashboard](https://dashboard.demo.autocredit.ng/settings/api).

While testing our API, your base [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) should always be:

`https://api.demo.autocredit.ng`

The Autocredit API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON request bodies, returns [JSON-encoded](http://www.json.org/) responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.
